# Corporate finance theory (FIN 723A): Course repository
### [William Mann](https://sites.google.com/site/williamgilesmann/), Goizueta Business School, Emory University

## Overview

This is a landing page for the course Github repository.
Not much to see here, because this is a theory course.
The only meaningful content is in the syllabus and the course notes.
Eventually I may create a richer landing page here for that content.
For now, you can find the links to those documents from my website.
