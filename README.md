# FIN323 Course Repository

## Overview

This is a README file for the Github repository for the course
FIN 723A (Investments) at Emory University taught by [William Mann](https://sites.google.com/site/williamgilesmann/).
Not much to see here because this is a theory course.
The only meaningful content is in the syllabus and the course notes.
Eventually I may create a richer landing page here for that content, but for you can find the links to those documents from my website.
